[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ssoft-org/MessengerUWP/_apis/build/status/Messenger%20UWP%20CI?branchName=develop)](https://dev.azure.com/ssoft-org/MessengerUWP/_build/latest?branchName=develop)

Messenger UWP is a Universal Windows Platform app that lets you access **Facebook Messenger on Windows 10 PCs, tablets and phones**.

This app is based on the Messenger website ([www.messenger.com](https://www.messenger.com)) by using a WebView and injecting some JavaScript and CSS code.

Because Facebook provides at least two versions of [www.messenger.com](https://www.messenger.com), we also have two know versions. Currently, we don't know why some users have access to Messenger v1 and some others to Messenger v2 (probably AB testing).
